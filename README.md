# Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis

Analyze Diwali sales data to improve customer experience and sales

In my Diwali sales analysis project using Python, I imported and cleaned data, removing duplicates and null values. Through bar charts, I discovered that married women aged 26-35 in Maharashtra and Karnataka, working in IT, healthcare, and aviation, exhibit a higher likelihood of purchasing products from the food, clothing, and electronics categories. These insights offer valuable targeting opportunities for businesses in these regions and industries.
